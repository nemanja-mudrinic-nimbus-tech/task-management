# Current idea

- Moving UI components to UI lib (inside package as a standalone)
- Setting up storybook
- Handle errors on frontend (they are not covered)
- Improving logic for cache
- Setting up prepush/precommit actions using husky
- Setting up CICD
- Setting up dockerfile that would work even without turborepo (turborepo has prune options but lock file stays on top level)
