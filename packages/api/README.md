This API is autogenerated.

To generate it again, you need to get into this folder. The yarn command is not optimized to be run from anywhere.

When you're in the folder, run `yarn generate` to get a new API.

In order to use the API, add it in your project

```
// package.json

...
  "dependencies": {
    "@task-management/api": "*"
  },
...
```

And then instantiate the main TaskManagement API class

```ts
const api = new TaskManagement({
  BASE: API_BASE_URL,
});
```

And then use any of the APIs, for example:

```ts
api.auth
  .login({
    username: "user",
    password: "password",
  })
  .then((result) => console.log("Login result", { result }));
```
